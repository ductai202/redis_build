# Hyperion Benchmark Report

## Environment

### Machine
| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| **CPU** | Intel Core i5-1135G7 @ 2.40GHz (11th Gen) |
| **Physical Cores** | 4 |
| **Logical Cores (HT)** | 8 |
| **RAM** | ~40 GB |
| **OS** | Windows 11 Pro |
| **Runtime** | .NET 10 (Preview) |
| **Build** | Release |

### Hyperion Thread Configuration (Multi-Thread Mode)
Hyperion automatically derives its thread layout from `Environment.ProcessorCount` (= 8 on this machine):

| Thread Pool | Count | Formula |
|---|---|---|
| **IO Handler threads** | 4 | `ProcessorCount / 2` (default) |
| **Worker threads** | 8 | `ProcessorCount` (optimized for this run) |
| **Total threads** | 12 | leveraging logical core count |

Each Worker owns a **private Storage shard**. Keys are consistently routed to the same worker via FNV-1a hash, so no locking is ever needed.

## Benchmark Commands

**Tool:** `redis-benchmark` (Redis for Windows v8.6.2 - Multi-threaded mode)

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Concurrent clients (`-c`) | 500 |
| Total requests (`-n`) | 1,000,000 |
| Key space (`-r`) | 1,000,000 unique keys |
| Payload | 3 bytes (default) |
| Keep-alive | Yes |

```bash
redis-benchmark -p 3001 -t set,get -c 500 -n 1000000 -r 1000000 --threads 3
```

> **How each mode was started:**
> ```
> # Origin Redis
> redis-server.exe --port 3000
>
> # Hyperion (single-thread mode)
> Hyperion.Server.exe --port 3000 --mode single
>
> # Hyperion (multi-thread share-nothing mode)
> Hyperion.Server.exe --port 3000 --mode multi
> ```

## Analysis

### Normal Workload (No Delay)
- **WSL Linux Performance**: When tested on WSL, the network stack overhead is minimal. Origin Redis reaches **117k GET req/s**. Hyperion Multi-Thread reaches **113.8k GET req/s** (achieving ~97% of official Redis throughput). Hyperion Single-Thread bottlenecks at around 43k, demonstrating that C#'s single-threaded event loop is compute-bound at that level on this hardware.

### Why Multi-Thread Wins Under Load (100µs Delay)
While single-thread mode is fast for raw I/O, the true power of the "share-nothing" architecture becomes obvious when simulating slow commands (like complex Lua scripts or large dataset scans). By injecting a synthetic **100µs delay** into execution, we observe:

| Environment | Mode | SET (req/s) | GET (req/s) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **WSL (Linux)** | Hyperion Single-Thread (100µs) | 39,086 | 36,995 |
| **WSL (Linux)** | **Hyperion Multi-Thread (100µs)** | **92,618** | **106,929** (2.89x faster) |

In a Single-Thread model, a slow command blocks the entire event loop, destroying throughput for all connected clients. In Hyperion's Multi-Thread model, a 100µs delay on one shard only affects that specific worker. The other 7 workers continue processing commands at full speed, allowing the server to maintain **106,000+ GET req/s**.

---

## Conclusion

Hyperion successfully proves the "share-nothing" architectural concept in C#/.NET. It reaches **~85% of official Redis throughput** on Linux for pure read workloads (hitting ~100k req/s), and demonstrates massive resilience under load, running **2.8x faster** than a single-threaded server when faced with slow commands.
