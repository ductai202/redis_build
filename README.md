# Hyperion

A Redis-compatible in-memory database, built from scratch in C#/.NET 10.

I started this project to deeply understand how Redis works under the hood — not just the API, but the internals: how it parses the wire protocol, manages key expiry, how a Skip List enables O(log N) ranked queries, and why single-threaded servers can outperform naively multi-threaded ones.

The **single-threaded mode** follows Redis's original architecture — a true event-loop design where one dedicated OS thread owns all command execution, fed by async IO handlers through a lock-free channel. The **multi-threaded mode** is inspired by [DragonflyDB](https://www.dragonflydb.io/)'s share-nothing architecture — each worker thread owns a private data shard with no locks, no contention, and no cross-thread coordination on the hot path.

Hyperion speaks standard RESP2, so you can connect with any `redis-cli` or Redis client library.

## What's Implemented

**Protocol** — Hand-written RESP2 parser, encoder, and decoder. Zero-copy parsing via `System.IO.Pipelines`.

**Data Structures** — All implemented from scratch, following the same algorithms used in Redis's source code:
- **Dict** — Key-value store with separate TTL tracking and coarse-clock LRU timestamps
- **Skip List** — Probabilistic sorted structure with span tracking for O(log N) rank queries (same as Redis's `zskiplist`)
- **ZSet** — Sorted Set using Dict + Skip List together (the classic Redis dual-structure trick)
- **Bloom Filter** — Probabilistic membership test with optimal sizing via Kirsch-Mitzenmacker double hashing
- **Count-Min Sketch** — Frequency estimation with configurable error/probability bounds
- **Eviction Pool** — Sampling-based approximate LRU (Redis's approach of sampling keys instead of maintaining a full LRU list)

**Commands:**

| Category | Commands |
|---|---|
| Connection | `PING`, `INFO` |
| String | `SET`, `GET`, `DEL`, `TTL`, `INCR`, `DECR` |
| Hash | `HSET`, `HGET`, `HDEL`, `HGETALL` |
| List | `LPUSH`, `RPUSH`, `LPOP`, `RPOP`, `LRANGE` |
| Set | `SADD`, `SREM`, `SISMEMBER`, `SMEMBERS` |
| Sorted Set | `ZADD`, `ZREM`, `ZSCORE`, `ZRANK`, `ZRANGE` |
| Bloom Filter | `BF.RESERVE`, `BF.MADD`, `BF.EXISTS` |
| Count-Min Sketch | `CMS.INITBYDIM`, `CMS.INITBYPROB`, `CMS.INCRBY`, `CMS.QUERY` |

**Server modes:**
- **Single-threaded** — Follows Redis's original event-loop architecture. One dedicated OS thread owns all command execution. Async IO handlers feed commands through a lock-free `Channel`. Responses are batched with `PipeWriter` — one flush per read batch.
- **Multi-threaded (share-nothing)** — Inspired by [DragonflyDB](https://www.dragonflydb.io/). N worker threads each own a private storage shard. IO Handlers route commands via FNV-1a hash. No mutexes, no spinlocks, no contention on the hot path.

**Key expiry** — Both lazy (check on access) and active (background sweep sampling and deleting expired keys).

## Architecture

### Single-Thread Mode

Follows **Redis's original event-loop architecture**. The goal is simple: **one thread, zero locks, maximum cache locality.**

Redis has always used a single-threaded event loop for command execution — `ae.c` in the Redis source. The reasons are well understood: no lock overhead, no cache line bouncing, deterministic execution order. Hyperion applies the same principle but uses C#'s `Channel<T>` and `LongRunning` task instead of `epoll`/`kqueue`.

#### 1. Connection Layer
The `TcpListener` accepts connections. For each client, a lightweight `async Task` (managed by the .NET thread pool) handles IO — reading bytes from the socket using `PipeReader`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    C1[Client 1] & C2[Client 2] & CN[Client N]
    -->|TCP connect| TL[TcpListener]
    TL -->|"AcceptTcpClientAsync\n(one Task per client)"| IH["Async IO Tasks\n(thread pool)"]
```

#### 2. Execution Layer
Each IO task parses complete RESP commands from its `PipeReader` and enqueues a `WorkItem` to a shared lock-free `Channel<WorkItem>`. A single dedicated OS thread (`LongRunning`) consumes the channel one item at a time and executes every command against the `CommandExecutor` — no synchronization needed because only this thread ever touches the data.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    IH["Async IO Tasks"]
    -->|"RespParser.TryParseCommand\nChannel.WriteAsync WorkItem"| CH["Channel WorkItem\nUnbounded lock-free"]
    CH -->|SingleReader| EL["Event Loop Thread\nLongRunning pthread"]
    EL --> CE[CommandExecutor]
    CE --> ST[("Storage\nplain Dictionary")]
    ST -->|result bytes| EL
    EL -->|"TCS.TrySetResult"| IH
```

#### 3. Response Layer
Once the IO task receives the result from the `TaskCompletionSource`, it calls `PipeWriter.Write()` — which buffers the bytes locally. After all commands in the current read batch are processed, a **single** `PipeWriter.FlushAsync()` sends them all in one syscall.

```mermaid

    IH["IO Task\n(per connection)"]
    -->|"PipeWriter.Write response\n(buffered, no syscall)"| PW["PipeWriter\nwrite buffer"]
    PW -->|"FlushAsync\nONE syscall per batch"| NET["NetworkStream"]
    NET --> C["Client"]
```

### Multi-Thread Mode (Share-Nothing)

Inspired by [DragonflyDB](https://www.dragonflydb.io/)'s share-nothing architecture. The goal: **scale across CPU cores with zero cross-thread data sharing.**

DragonflyDB (C++) proved that the right answer to multi-core scaling is not adding locks to a single store — it is eliminating shared state entirely. Each worker owns its own private shard, and keys are deterministically routed to shards via hash. Hyperion applies the same design in C#/.NET.

On an 8-core machine Hyperion spins up 8 Workers and 4 IO Handlers. Since a key always maps to the same Worker via FNV-1a hash, storage shards are completely isolated — no locking is ever needed.

#### 1. Connection Layer
`HyperionServer` accepts connections and distributes them to IO Handlers in **round-robin** using `Interlocked.Increment`. Each `IOHandler` is an async loop that reads from its assigned clients using `PipeReader`.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    C1[Client 1] & C2[Client 2] & CN[Client N]
    -->|TCP connect| TL[TcpListener]
    TL -->|"round-robin\nInterlocked.Increment"| IH1[IOHandler 0]
    TL --> IH2[IOHandler 1]
    TL --> IHN[IOHandler N]
```

#### 2. Routing & Execution Layer
Each `IOHandler` parses commands and calls `HyperionServer.DispatchAsync()`. The dispatcher resolves any **Hash Tag** (`{tag}` syntax, same as Redis Cluster), runs FNV-1a hash mod N, and enqueues the `WorkerTask` to the matching Worker's `Channel`. Each Worker is a `LongRunning` thread with its own **private** `Storage` — no locking needed.

**FNV-1a** (Fowler-Noll-Vo) is used because it is extremely fast for short strings (the most common key type), provides excellent distribution, and uses `stackalloc Span<byte>` for zero heap allocation per routing call.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    IH["IOHandler\n(parses RESP)"]
    -->|"DispatchAsync WorkerTask"| RT

    subgraph RT["Router — HyperionServer.DispatchAsync"]
        HT["1. Resolve Hash Tag\n{tag} extraction"]
        FNV["2. FNV-1a hash mod N\nstackalloc — zero heap alloc"]
        HT --> FNV
    end

    FNV -->|"key % N = 0"| W0
    FNV -->|"key % N = 1"| W1
    FNV -->|"key % N = N"| WN

    subgraph W0[Worker 0]
        CH0["Channel WorkItem"] --> EL0["LongRunning Thread"]
        EL0 --> S0[("Shard 0\nDictionary")]
    end
    subgraph W1[Worker 1]
        CH1["Channel WorkItem"] --> EL1["LongRunning Thread"]
        EL1 --> S1[("Shard 1\nDictionary")]
    end
    subgraph WN[Worker N]
        CHN["Channel WorkItem"] --> ELN["LongRunning Thread"]
        ELN --> SN[("Shard N\nDictionary")]
    end
```

**Multi-Key Commands — Scatter-Gather:** For commands like `DEL key1 key2` where keys map to different shards, `DispatchAsync` splits the command into per-shard sub-tasks, dispatches them all concurrently, then aggregates results — inspired by [Dragonfly's transaction model](https://www.dragonflydb.io/blog/transactions-in-dragonfly). **Hash Tags** (e.g. `{user:1}:name` and `{user:1}:age`) force related keys to the same shard to avoid cross-shard overhead entirely.

#### 3. Response Layer
Same as single-thread: the `IOHandler` awaits all `TCS` results for the current read batch, writes them into a `PipeWriter` buffer, and flushes once.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    W["Worker N\nTCS.TrySetResult"]
    -->|"await task.ReplyCompletion"| IH["IOHandler"]
    IH -->|"PipeWriter.Write\n(buffered, no syscall)"| PW[PipeWriter]
    PW -->|"FlushAsync\nONE syscall per batch"| NET[NetworkStream]
    NET --> C[Client]
```
